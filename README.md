# CI/CD, Accessibility & Performance Optimization Project

This project is a completed task from [The RS School](https://rs.school/) ShortTrack course aimed at practicing real-world development workflows and quality improvements.

The goal of the task was to:
- Set up a complete **CI/CD pipeline** using GitHub Actions
- Implement **accessibility improvements** based on Lighthouse reports
- Perform **performance optimization** using DevTools and modern web practices

## Features

### üîÑ CI/CD Setup

The project includes a fully functional CI/CD pipeline configured with **GitHub Actions** and **Netlify**.  
The goal was to automate quality checks for every commit and ensure safe and smooth deployment.

#### üîê Branch Protection
To prevent direct pushes to `main`, a **branch protection rule** was added:

- "Require a pull request before merging" is enabled.
- "Require status checks to pass before merging" ensures that builds and tests must pass.

#### ‚úÖ Commit Validation Workflow

A GitHub Actions workflow [`commit-validation.yml`](https://github.com/bt-diana/ci-cd/blob/feature/ci-cd/.github/workflows/commit-validation.yml) was created to validate every commit pushed to any `feature/*` branch.  
The workflow performs the following steps:

- Checkout the repository
- Install Node.js
- Install dependencies from `package-lock.json`
- Run `npm run lint`
- Run `npm run test`
- Run `npm run build`

This ensures all commits follow code quality standards and are buildable.

#### üöÄ Pull Request Checks

When a pull request is opened or updated against `main`, the same validation workflow runs automatically.  
Thanks to the branch protection rules, **a PR cannot be merged unless all checks pass**.

#### üè∑Ô∏è Branch Name Validation

To enforce a consistent branching strategy, another workflow [`branch-naming.yml`](https://github.com/bt-diana/ci-cd/blob/feature/ci-cd/.github/workflows/branch-naming.yml) checks that all PR branches targeting `main` start with `feature/`.

#### üåê Deployment Pipeline

A deployment pipeline was configured in [`deployment.yml`](https://github.com/bt-diana/ci-cd/blob/feature/ci-cd/.github/workflows/deployment.yml) using the [Netlify Deploy GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/netlify-deploy).  
It automatically deploys preview builds of the app for **every push** to a branch that has an **open pull request**.

This allows reviewers to test the latest version of the app before merging into `main`.


### ‚ôø Accessibility Improvements
- Accessibility score increased to **‚â•95** in Lighthouse.
- **Contrast fixes**: unified and darkened color palette for better text readability.
- **Aria labels** added to key interactive elements:
  - Price and stock inputs
  - Sliders and thumbs
  - Search field
- **Touch targets** improved by increasing slider sizes and enabling pointer events.

### ‚ö° Performance Optimization
- **Initial metrics** (FCP, LCP, CLS, Speed Index) documented via Lighthouse and DevTools.
- Optimizations implemented include:
  - Defined image sizes to avoid layout shifts
  - Converted all thumbnails to `.webp`
  - Added `loading="lazy"` to off-screen assets
  - Self-hosted fonts to reduce render-blocking
  - Resized and optimized hero image (`eucalypt`) for faster LCP
